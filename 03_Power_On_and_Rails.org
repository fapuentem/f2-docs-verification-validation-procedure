* Purpose
Power up the board with current-limited supply and verify the presence, values, and basic sequencing of primary rails. Confirm that no components overheat and that power-good signals assert as expected.

* Scope
- PCB revision ~v3.1.x~ (or as specified)
- Jetson Orin NX SOM installed (note SKU)
- Applies after [[file:02_Power_Sanity.org][02_Power_Sanity]] has *passed*

* Safety & ESD
- [ ] ESD strap connected, mat grounded
- [ ] Current limit set on bench PSU
- [ ] Heatsink installed on SOM
- [ ] Keep scope/DMM grounds secure; avoid ground loops

* Required Equipment
- Bench PSU with adjustable current limit
- DMM (voltage and continuity)
- Oscilloscope (optional, for sequencing and ripple)
- IR thermometer or finger-touch thermal check (brief)

* Acceptance Criteria (summary)
- Inrush does not trip PSU OCP; steady-state current within expected range
- Primary rails within ±5% of spec (unless otherwise designed)
- No part is too hot to touch (~>60–70°C) within the first minute at idle

* Setup A
1. Disconnect all modules or peripherals (5G modem, NVMe, Wi-Fi card, Jetson Orin NX or other M.2 cards).
2. Set bench PSU voltage to nominal VIN (per board spec) and set current limit to a cautious value (e.g., ~= 1.2–1.5× expected idle=).
3. Connect scope/DMM grounds at a single, solid ground point near input.
4. Prepare to record current and rail measurements.

** Initial Power-On
- [ ] Enable bench PSU output (note any inrush behavior and current peak).
- [ ] Confirm no audible noise, smoke, or odor.
- [ ] Observe steady-state input current after ~10–20 s.

*** Input Current
| Condition                  | Current | Units | Notes |
|----------------------------+---------+-------+-------|
| Idle (no load)             |         | A     |       |
| Peak at power-on (approx.) |         | A     |       |

** Rail Measurements
Measure DC values with DMM at labeled test points (TPs) or bulk caps. Add scope captures for ripple/sequencing if available.

*** Optional: Ripple / Sequencing (Scope)
Capture power-good and rail ramp if you need to verify order and timing.

** Thermal Check (Quick)
- [ ] Touch/IR check: no device uncomfortably hot at idle (brief touch test)
- [ ] VRMs and inductors warm but stable; no runaway heating

*** Notes
List any hotspots and attach photos with thermal readings if available.
