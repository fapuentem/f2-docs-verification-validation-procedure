* Purpose
Power up the board with current-limited supply and verify the presence, values, and basic sequencing of primary rails. Confirm that no components overheat and that power-good signals assert as expected.

* Scope
- PCB revision ~v3.1.x~ (or as specified)
- Jetson Orin NX SOM installed (note SKU)
- Applies after [[file:02_Power_Sanity.org][02_Power_Sanity]] has *passed*

* Safety & ESD
- [ ] ESD strap connected, mat grounded
- [ ] Current limit set on bench PSU
- [ ] Heatsink installed on SOM if required by spec
- [ ] Keep scope/DMM grounds secure; avoid ground loops

* Required Equipment
- Bench PSU with adjustable current limit
- DMM (voltage and continuity)
- Oscilloscope (optional, for sequencing and ripple)
- IR thermometer or finger-touch thermal check (brief)

* Acceptance Criteria (summary)
- Inrush does not trip PSU OCP; steady-state current within expected range
- Primary rails within ±5% of spec (unless otherwise designed)
- Power-good (PG) lines assert; no repeated cycling
- No part is too hot to touch (~>60–70°C) within the first minute at idle

* Setup
1. Disconnect all nonessential peripherals (USB devices, cameras, etc.).
2. Set bench PSU voltage to nominal VIN (per board spec) and set current limit to a cautious value (e.g., ~= 1.2–1.5× expected idle=).
3. Connect scope/DMM grounds at a single, solid ground point near input.
4. Prepare to record current and rail measurements.

* Initial Power-On
- [ ] Enable bench PSU output (note any inrush behavior and current peak).
- [ ] Confirm no audible noise, smoke, or odor.
- [ ] Observe steady-state input current after ~10–20 s.

** Input Current
| Condition                  | Current | Units | Notes |
|----------------------------+---------+-------+-------|
| Idle after boot (no load)  |         | A     |       |
| Peak at power-on (approx.) |         | A     |       |

* Rail Measurements
Measure DC values with DMM at labeled test points (TPs) or bulk caps. Add scope captures for ripple/sequencing if available.

** DC Levels
| Rail/Test Point |   Spec | Measured | Units | Pass? | Notes |

** Optional: Ripple / Sequencing (Scope)
Capture power-good and rail ramp if you need to verify order and timing.

* Power-Good (PG) and Enables
Document PG/enable status. If available, probe the corresponding test pads or read via GPIO/I²C status registers.

* Thermal Check (Quick)
- [ ] Touch/IR check: no device uncomfortably hot at idle (brief touch test)
- [ ] VRMs and inductors warm but stable; no runaway heating

** Notes
List any hotspots and attach photos with thermal readings if available.

* (Optional) Babel Aids
** Log input current via INA/PMIC (if present)
If the board exposes current sensors under sysfs or I²C, this snippet logs a few samples. Update paths as needed.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :results output :exports both
# Example paths—update for your platform if you have INA3221/PMIC rails exposed
for n in /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon*/curr*_input; do
  [ -f "$n" ] || continue
  echo "$(date +%F_%T) $n: $(cat "$n") uA"
done | head -n 20
#+END_SRC

** Quick voltage readback (if rails are exposed via sysfs)
#+BEGIN_SRC bash :results output :exports both
for n in /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon*/in*_input; do
  [ -f "$n" ] || continue
  echo "$(date +%F_%T) $n: $(cat "$n") mV"
