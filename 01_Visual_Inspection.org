* Purpose
Verify manufacturing and assembly quality of the F2SC01 carrier board
*before any power is applied*. This step screens for mechanical,
assembly, and workmanship issues that could cause failures during
bring-up.

* Scope
- PCB revision ~v3.1.x~ (or as specified)
- Production, pilot, or RMA boards
- Inspection class: Production QA (record deviations below)

* Metadata

* Safety & ESD
- [ ] ESD wrist strap connected and tested
- [ ] ESD-safe surface/mat
- [ ] Handle by edges; avoid heatsink interface surfaces and RF connectors

* Required Tools
- Good lighting + inspection microscope (≥10× recommended)
- DMM (continuity only for this step, no power applied)
- Torque driver for standoffs (if applicable)
- Camera/phone for evidence

* Acceptance Criteria (summary)
- No visible mechanical damage or missing/incorrect parts
- Proper polarity/orientation of polarized components and connectors
- Solder joints smooth, shiny, and fully wetted; no bridges or opens
- Cleanliness acceptable; no conductive debris or severe flux residues
- Labels/barcodes present and legible

* Identification & Markings
- [ ] PCB revision printed matches expected BOM/ECN
- [ ] Board serial label present and readable
- [ ] Date code / lot code present
- [ ] Polarity and pin‑1 indicators visible for ICs, diodes, electrolytics
- [ ] Orientation keying for M.2, JST, headers correct

* Mechanical Assembly
- [ ] Connectors aligned (no leaning/tilt beyond tolerance)
- [ ] Mounting holes unobstructed; plating undamaged
- [ ] RF connectors (U.FL/MMCX) intact; no lifted pads

* Solder Quality
- [ ] No bridges, cold joints, voids, or insufficient solder
- [ ] QFN/BGA periphery fillets acceptable; no solder balls nearby
- [ ] Through‑hole joints with proper fill; wetting on lead and pad

* Connectors & Interfaces
- [ ] M.2 sockets undamaged; keys not deformed
- [ ] USB mechanically solid; shield tabs soldered
- [ ] Test points accessible and labeled

* Cleanliness & Coatings
- [ ] No metal shavings or foreign objects
- [ ] Flux residues minimal; no sticky surfaces near high‑impedance nets
- [ ] Conformal coat (if used) uniform; keep‑out zones respected

* Photo Evidence
Attach photos in =evidence/= and link them here.

- [ ] Any rework :: [[file:evidence/rework_closeup.jpg]]

* Findings Log
Record any nonconformities (NCR). Use severity to aid disposition.
| ID | Area | RefDes / Zone | Severity | Description | Evidence              | Action | Status |
|----+------+---------------+----------+-------------+-----------------------+--------+--------|
|  1 |      |               | Critical |             | [[file:evidence/xxx.jpg]] |        | Open   |

Severity legend: =Critical= (safety/damage risk), =Major= (function risk), =Minor= (cosmetic).

* Disposition
- [ ] PASS — proceed to *02_Power_Sanity*
- [ ] FAIL — hold for rework/RMA

* Sign‑off
