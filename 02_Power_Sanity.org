* Purpose
Screen for gross electrical issues *before any power is applied*. The goal is to catch shorts, assembly errors, and missing protection components that could damage the board or bench supply during first power-on.

* Scope
- PCB revision ~v3.1.x~ (or as specified)
- Boards from production, pilot, or RMA
- Applies to VIN path, input protection, and primary DC/DC inputs

* Safety & Electrostatic Discharge (ESD)
- [ ] ESD strap connected, mat grounded
- [ ] No modules or peripherals attached (5G modem, NVMe, Wi-Fi card, Jetson Orin NX or other M.2 cards)
- [ ] Digital multimeter (DMM) continuity/ohms mode only; *do not* inject power from DMM
- [ ] Avoid probing small RF parts

* Required Equipment
- Digital multimeter (DMM) with continuity/diode/ohms modes
- Bench Power supply unit (PSU) with adjustable current limit (leave *off* for this step)
- ESD accessories
- [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JVN5esHxpJAKt_KkhkdePhA0U1uXdHZs?usp=drive_link][Board documentation / schematic references (TP list if available)]]

* Acceptance Criteria (summary)
- VIN↔GND resistance is *not* a hard short; within expected range for populated caps
- Polarity protection elements (ideal diode/ORing or reverse diode) present and oriented
- No short on primary rails (5V, 3V3, 1V8, etc.) as seen from their bulk inputs

* Procedure

** VIN–GND resistance screen (no power)
- Using DMM ~Ω~ mode, measure resistance between *VIN+* and *GND (J5)*.
- Expectation: typically =1–200 kΩ= (capacitors may charge; reading rises).
- If you measure < ~5 kΩ steady, investigate before proceeding.

|--------------------+-------+-------+-----------------------------------|
| VIN–GND resistance |       | kΩ    | Meter settles after a few seconds |

** Primary rail input shorts (no power)
Probe at the bulk input caps of each converter (or labeled TPs). Record low-ohms red flags.
- [ ] +5V path (TP1, TP57, and TP48) not shorted to GND
- [ ] +3V3 path (TP58, TP51) not shorted to GND
- [ ] +3V8 path (TP31) not shorted to GND
- [ ] +1V8 path (TP30, and TP61) not shorted to GND
- [ ] Any always-on rail (TP59) not shorted to GND

*** Record
| Rail / Node    | Resistance | Units | Pass? | Notes |
|----------------+------------+-------+-------+-------|
| +5V input cap  |            | kΩ    |       |       |
| +3V3 input cap |            | kΩ    |       |       |
| +1V8 input cap |            | kΩ    |       |       |
| Other: ________  |            | kΩ    |       |       |
|                |            |       |       |       |


** Current limit planning (for next step)
Set a conservative current limit on the bench PSU for initial power-on.
Suggested rule of thumb: ~=I_idle x 1.5=~ (or as per board spec).

*** Plan
| Parameter                 | Value | Units | Notes          |
|---------------------------+-------+-------+----------------|
| Expected idle current     |       | A     | With SOM only  |
| Initial PSU current limit |       | A     | 1.2–1.5 × idle |

Severity legend: =Critical= (damage likely), =Major= (function at risk), =Minor= (cosmetic/process).

* Disposition
